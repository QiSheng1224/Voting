##Instructions:
 In the terminal, making sure you're in ../repo-Team4/Project1 folder, simply enter the following commands: 

 1. `Make`
 2. `./BallotSystem`
 3. If Successful, then an Audit File will be created and you will be told that it has been completed by the terminal. 

From here, you will be prompted to enter a filename. For this to work, please make sure the file you're trying to enter is in the Project1 folder as well (You should see a Makefile and that's how you know you're in the right folder).

For unit testing, simply run:
1. `Make test`

##Issues (Stuff they should know):
1. This has NOT been tested outside of school computers. For everything to compile properly, please run this program using the school computers (Vole or SSH into atlas).
2. UNIT TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE, BUT WORKS (We ran out of time).
